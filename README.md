# MIST-4610-Project-1
### Group 2: #### 
Our team decided to model a database that supports fantasy football analysis, focusing on player statistics, game outcomes, and team performance across multiple leagues. In our project's database design, we created 12 entities to encapsulate all relevant information, establishing relationships between these entities to form a comprehensive data model.From the perspective of a fantasy football league, we modeled teams, players, and games to represent the core components of player statistics and team performance. From there, we introduced entities that manage player scoring data, game results, and player rankings to facilitate performance tracking and comparison across teams.On the analysis side of the model, we created entities to evaluate player performance, such as weekly projections and player health status, helping to predict future outcomes and identify potential draft picks or trades. Additionally, we integrated a system to track league standings, manage team rosters, and evaluate player performance metrics, enabling more informed decisions for team management and roster adjustments.This scenario illustrates how our solution provides a comprehensive framework for managing fantasy football data, tracking player statistics, league performance, and optimizing team decisions. It helps identify trends in player performance, set up teams, and even predict future outcomes based on historical data.
